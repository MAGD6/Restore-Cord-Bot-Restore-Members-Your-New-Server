Winning When a player no longer has any cards and the game ends, they receive points. All opponents’ cards are given to the winner and points are counted. This also applies even if the last card is an Action card, such as a Draw Two or a Wild Draw 4 – The next player must draw the required cards which will then be tallied up.
